Nanojit
=======

Nanojit is a small cross platform C++ library that emits machine
code. It was originally part of Adobe's Tamarin ActionScript VM. It is
also used by Mozilla in their 'TraceMonkey' JavaScript implementation.

The original Nanojit repository is maintained by Mozilla and Adobe in
a mercurial repository at:

  http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nanojit-central

I'm using it a couple of git based projects so I regularly import
the mercurial repository to:

  http://github.com/doublec/nanojit-central

This git repository has two branches:

  nanojit-central
    An unchanged mirror of the nanojit-central mercurial repository
  master
    nanojit-central plus minor changes by me:
      1. Added this README
      2. Generate a libnanojit.a
